# Transformer-Multi-Language-Translator
A multi-langauge translator that utilizes the transformer neural network model from the paper titled Attention is all you need. 

## Samples

Since I do not know many of the langauges I have trained on the Transformer model, I will be using more robust translators as comparison such as Google Translate.

### English -> French
